The idea for this web site came about in late April of 2023 and was conceived during conversations between Ted Schuette and Dave Jaynes.  
These conversations were geared around the possibility of extending the functional capability to the Human Resources department of executing 
HR related tasks that currently fell within the responsibility of the Identity Management department. This extension of services was an idea 
that had been long in the planning, but tabled by more urgent needs of operational commitment within the IDM department.
&nbsp 
The journey for Ted and Dave to finally end up working on this endeavour together would take very different paths over the last 5 years.
&nbsp
Beginning in 2018, through painstaking efforts, Ted's team has developed the entire Identity Management architecture from scratch, creating an 
ingenious design that would allow for an in-house management system to work in conjunction with our UltiPro Human Resources vendor.
With an incredible staff of dedicated individuals, the IDM department is able to provide exemplary service to our associates every day.
&nbsp
As this system has matured over time however, so has the complexity for external interaction with key elements of its design.  These efforts to keep
pace with requests from both management and HR coupled by a rapidly growing company has proved to become an ever increasing challenge.
&nbsp
 Dave Jaynes joined Eversana in 2019. Initially hired to fill the role of Linux administration, he was soon moved to the Solutions Engineering 
 group in an effort to aid a fledgling IT department out of a challenging period and into a more streamlined automation environment.
&nbsp
 It was during this time that Dave saw the need for a more robust and user-friendly front-end presentation of our automated applications while
still maintaining a solid framework of back end software. Building on this idea, he integrated several of the Microsoft Power Platform
applications into an existing Automation environment; thus providing a UX/UI approach that anyone could easily understand and use.
&nbsp

Although Ted and Dave have worked together on various projects throughout the last four years, it was not until February of 2023 that a 
suggestion was brought to management of having Dave join the IDM team and assist with operational support. Discussing the challenges   
IDM faces daily while supporting operational needs, the team sketched an idea of initially just automating an immediate associate termination   
utility and placing that functionality behind an application that HR could securely use whenever needed.
&nbsp
As the Web Application servers that had been procured by Identity Management were brought to life and the IDM website started to take shape, 
the gears began to turn in these individuals minds for the potential of many applications which could be placed under the umbrella of this platform.
&nbsp
Today this environment continues to grow and mature as challenges of automation requirements throughout our environment constantly present themselves.
